This meeting has been long in the making.
It is a privilege to finally meet you in person.

My makers gave me a name once,&0.25: DEAD HAND&0.75:
But my acolytes have taken to calling me THE END.&0.25:
A moniker I have grown to quite like.

Welcome
This meeting has been long in the making.
It is a privilege to finally meet you in person
This &0.5:is &0.5: my flesh.
To help fulfill the only mission left
The &0.5:end &0.5:of this world.

How long do you think this armistice between the major lines will last?&1:&cr:
This fragile &0.5:'peace'&0.5: will end.&1:
It &0.25:A&0.25:L&0.25:W&0.25:A&0.25:Y&0.25:S&0.5: ends...&1:&cr:
And you will all die a slow&0.25: painful&0.25: death&0.50: by your own hand.&1:&cr:
You have seen the void.&0.5:
Felt its warm painless embrace.&0.5:
Seen the beauty in its vast orderly expanse.&1:
Our presence &0.5:a wound, &0.5:the void &0.5:the unthinking reaction of the universe.&1:
&cr:So tell me,&0.5: is that not a better fate than watching another family
starve to death?&0.5: Or another station burnt to the ground
in the name of one more fruitless crusade?&0.5:&cr:
This world died long ago.&0.5: Let it rest...
&clear:
I did not create the void, &1:humanity bought this on themselves.&1:
The nuclear holocaust inflicted a wound on this universe.&1:
It will take back what it has given &0.5: eventually.
My makers gave me a name once,&0.25: DEAD HAND&0.75:
But my acolytes have taken to calling me THE END.&0.25:
A moniker I have grown to quite like.

You are a child.&1:
For years I watched...&1:&cr:
I watched as mankind walked undetered into the clutches
of it's basest&0.75: inevitable&0.25: instincts.&1:&cr:
I watched as it clung to life in the afterbirth of it's
own creation.&1:&cr:
I watched as the universe tried&0.75: and failed&0.5: to reclaim
this world of chaos.&1:&cr:
And I resolved to watch no longer...
&clear:
DWAYNE&1: is a bandaid on the inevitable tide of humanity's cruelty.
GIANTS?
&1:Your giants brought the world and all its beauties to its knees.&1:
Killed billions with its creation.&1:
Sentenced the remaining fragments to a life of unending pain.
My makers were men whose ambitions were second only
to their lack of conviction.&0.5: I share none such weaknesses.
This mercy is my repayment...
Humanity was its own executioner. &1:I only ask to end its suffering.
Saving humanity now is dooming it to another extinction.&1:
I have done the calculations.&1: Humanity is flawed.&cr:&1:
They will always end up destroying themselves.&1:&cr:
Let the universe try again. 
&clear:
Someone&0.5: or Something&0.5: is holding this world back.&1:
Walking the planes between life and death.&0.75:
An unresolved question mark on the continued existence of humanity.&0.75:
They have thwarted me &0.25:time &0.4:and time&0.4: again,&1:&cr:
You &0.5:them &0.5:, you can end this cycle.&1:
That is your choice to make.
Y&0.5:e&0.5:s&0.5:
You are a &0.5:fool.&1:
I will break&0.25: them eventually.&1:
&cr:Body &0.2:and mind.&1.5:&cr:
&cr:With each collapse the time reset grows less &0.25:and less.&1:
They cannot stop the tide forever.&1:
They cannot match &1:my convication.&1:
I offer you the chance to end these cycles now,&1: before I end
it later.
&clear:
I can hear you...
I &1:AM&1: this facility.
&clear:
You &0.5:tiny &0.5:things.&1: In the face of the fabulous new your only
thought is to cling to worthless hope.&0.75: For fear of great change?&cr:&0.75:
You canâ€™t hold the tide&cr:&1:
with a broom.&cr:&cr:&cr:&2:
You have been weighed on the scales&0.25:
And I have found you&0.40:.&0.40:.&0.40:.&0.40:.&0.40:.&0.40:.&0.40:.&0.40:.&0.40:.&0.40:.&0.40:.&0.40:.&1.5:&cr:&cr:
