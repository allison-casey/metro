      The juggernaut has massive front armor that they use
      to bulrush through terrain and provide cover to
      advancing troops. This leaves his rear armor
      comparatively weak, at 5DT. If 50+ damage is dealt
      to his rear armor in one round he will be stunned
      and fall to one knee, where a weakpoint in his
      neck armor will be revealed. Doing this crit cycle
      twice will instant kill him.
