* Independent Hideout
- Reward :: 600 without killing, 300 with  
- Urgent? :: false
An independent stalker faction will have set up a way
station directly over a Spartan safe house hidden in the
basement. Maria needs them gone, preferable without killing
them. She can't tell them to move without giving away the
location of the safe house. 

The stalkers at this way station will be reluctant to move
as the location is an ideal stopping point for artifact
hunting in neighboring territory, while also being a
relatively location less mutant and fascit/bandit activity.

There is no set way of getting the stalker's to leave the
way station, that is up to the player to come up with. 

** possible solutions
- Lure several monsters to the location to scare them off
- Pretend the place his haunted
- Kill them :(
- Stink them out with sewer sludge
