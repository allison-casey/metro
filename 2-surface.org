# The Surface
## Dialogue
### On leaving the tunnels
You emerge to a rotten world of twisted metal and burnt
asphalt. Islands of snow covered asphalt dot the valleys
between broken buildings. The cold wind buffets your face as
you take in the stench of the surface, alien and unfamiliar. 

### First time seeing the library
You enter into a vaulted marble room, all around you shelves
tower over you, a multitude of books at your fingertips.
Everything in its place, a small echo of a world long since
turned to ash. The only acknowledgment of the new world is
the hazy red thunderous sky streaming in through the
shattered windows.

## Steps
1. Party exits the tunnels
2. Roll encounter on the way to the library
  - (1-2)    Hunted by a Deamon
  - (3-6)    Two blood suckers
  - (7-12)   Bandits
  - (13-18)  Back of Nosalis
  - (19-20)  Loot
3. Enter the library
  - Administrators office is on the second floor. The party
  can either get there by battle through some Librarians or
  make their way toward the first floor offices which have
  caved in allowing access to the second floor.
  - After getting the keys from The Administrator. They can
  descend to the vaults where they will acquire the balance
  sheets that will show an order of SVD MK. 2s (the same
  model looted off of the assassins) sent to *Ulitsa
  Starokachalovskaya*. While reading off the list fill in
  some random stuff like N tons of rebar or concrete to the
  surrounding stations as well.
  - The area will be guarded by a rather annoying but mildly
  harmless poltergeist that will chuck stuff at them but
  deal minimal damage.
4. After leaving the library they will be confronted by
another group of acolytes sent by The End.
  - It will ask the party to submit to the will of The End
  or die.
  - Last acolyte to die (if in combat) will be resurrected
  as a Vessel. A much more powerful version of that acolyte
  directly controlled by The End.
  - If the party dies here the world will be reset (They
  will lose their items, but retain the knowledge of where
  to go). On reset the world will be different with more
  noticeable changes in people's speech and people
  disappearing from existence.
